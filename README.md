# Work Scheduler

## Description

This is a 24 hour work day scheduler application that allows a user to insert a task in the form of text in the assigned time block for each hour according to the user's local date and time. The application displays hour time-blocks that have passed / ended as grey. The current hour time-block is displayed as red. The hour time-blocks in the future, are displayed as green. <br />
